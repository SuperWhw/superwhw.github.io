## Resume

### Experiences

#### Google
- Jun. 2022 -- Present
- Built machine learning systems to improve information quality on Google Maps.
- Implemented new features and trained new models to help reduce abuse rate and increase good merchants onboarding rate on Google Maps.

#### Microsoft
- Sep. 2020 -- Jun. 2021
- Software Engineer Intern
- Trained XML-RoBERTa model in Python on multilingual domain classification, intent classification and slot tagging tasks. 
- Coordinated with team to build Adapter layer for supporting multiple tasks offline training separately and online inference parallel. Improved development agility and saved resources including 500 V100 GPUs.
- Distilled TULR pretrained model from 24L to 6L leveraged MiniLM, finetuned model for QnA topic task, improved F1 to 85\%, optimized inference latency to 10ms via model compression.
- Implemented combined linear-pooling layer and supported ONNX model export for FPGA finetune, achieved 90\% reduction in running time with FlameGraph.
- Scraped online service to get over 20+ million queries and tested gap between online and offline inference results.
- Created a novel approach to leverage the ensemble effect of retrieve and rerank MiniLM models for Bing search engine.
- Developed and coded end-to-end integrated training pipeline in Python for retrieve and rerank models, verified a higher recall number of positive data on evaluate dataset.
- Handled 600+ million queries using multi-processing, lmdb database and distributed data parallel techniques, and accelerated training process up to 2.5x.

#### Bosch
- May 2020 -- Aug. 2020
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern
- Helped factory predict cutters chipping in advance, based on current and pressure features curve of machines. Reduced downtime of production line and saved cost for factory.
- Developed a lite sequential prediction model in Python with LSTM, CNN, and Attention, based on Keras, achieved 82\% accuracy.
